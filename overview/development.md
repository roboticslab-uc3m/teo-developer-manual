# Overview: Development

There are mainly two repositories concerned with development of TEO software, which are in fact defined at [roboticslab-uc3m](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m) organization level.

- [developer-manual](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/developer-manual): Developer Manual for [roboticslab-uc3m](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m).
- [project-generator](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/project-generator): Project structure and file generation for [roboticslab-uc3m](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m), using templates and user CLI input.

These in turn refer to additional documentation of TEO's hardware:

- [datasheets-and-manuals](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/datasheets-and-manuals): Third party datasheets, manuals, mechanical layout drawings, electronic schematics...
- [teo-electronics](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/teo-electronics): All sort of schematics for TEO's electronic boards.
