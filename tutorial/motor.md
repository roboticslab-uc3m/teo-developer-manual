# Tutorial: Motor Control

Throughout this section, refer to the [Joint Indexes (YARP ports)](diagrams.html#joint-indexes)  diagram to see port names and joint indexes, as well as the [Joint Directions of Rotation](diagrams.html#joint-directions-of-rotation) diagram.

## Directly talking to ports

Recall that this is hackish and subject to change. From a terminal, connect to the limb you prefer (substitute `leftArm` following the above mentioned diagram):

```bash
yarp rpc /teoSim/leftArm/rpc:i
```

From within this, we can send joint space movements, read encoders, etc. For instance, send an absolute joint position command, to joint 0, setting the target to -25 degrees:

```text
set pos 0 -25
```

You should in turn receive should get some kind of feedback, such as:

```text
Response: [ok]
```

In line with the hacks mentioned above, refer to a more exhaustive list at: [yarp-tricks: remote_controlboard (from developer-manual)](https://robots.uc3m.es/developer-manual/appendix/yarp-tricks.html#remotecontrolboard)

## Via GUIs

Two options to launch the YARP motor GUI for `teoSim`:

- Via terminal:

  ```bash
  yarpmotorgui --from yarpmotorgui/teoSim.ini
  ```

- Via the application manager (better practice): Navigate through `Applications` > `teoSimTools_App` > right-click on `yarpmotorgui` > `Run`

Any of the two options, and clicking `OK` (ignore the current warnings regarding hands for now) should get you a window similar to the one depicted below.

## Via APIs

The preferred approach, using the APIs provided by YARP within our programs and scripts.
