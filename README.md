For now most material is in: [kinematics-dynamics](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/kinematics-dynamics)  <-- Click here!

This is because `teo-main` was renamed. Soon you'll have a new funcional `teo-main`.

Note that the simulator of kinematics-dynamics, teoSim, will soon be replaced by components from [openrave-yarp-plugins](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/openrave-yarp-plugins), which also includes collision avoidance. Keep up on this on: https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/QA/issues/2 and https://github.com/orgs/roboticslab-uc3m/projects/2

The robot device drivers are in [yarp-devices](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/yarp-devices).

The robot vision is in [vision](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/vision). Tts/asr is there but will be migrated to [yarp-devices](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/yarp-devices).

Also still lots of material on [the wiki](http://robots.uc3m.es)!

We'll be porting material and updating little by little!
