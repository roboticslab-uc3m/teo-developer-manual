# teo-software-manual

Welcome to the tentative entry point for TEO software.

The main TEO software repository is called [teo-main](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/teo-main). It pulls contents from the following repositories:

- [teo-software-manual](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/teo-software-manual): This TEO software manual.
- [teo-hardware-manual](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/teo-hardware-manual): The TEO hardware manual.
- [teo-openrave-models](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/teo-openrave-models)
- [installation-guides](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/installation-guides)
- [openrave-yarp-plugins](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/openrave-yarp-plugins)
- [kinematics-dynamics](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/kinematics-dynamics)
- [vision](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/vision)
- [speech](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/speech)
- [tools](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/tools)

Notes on [teo-main](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/teo-main) and sub-repositories:
- Due to migration efforts ([click here to read the full story](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/QA/issues/2)), [teo-main](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/teo-main) is still not fully functional. It is best to download and install each separate repository. If there is an issue on any given one, post a GitHub issue on the corresponding repository.
- The `teoSim` simulator of [kinematics-dynamics](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/kinematics-dynamics) will soon be replaced by components from [openrave-yarp-plugins](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/openrave-yarp-plugins), which also include collision avoidance. Keep up on this on: https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/QA/issues/2 and https://github.com/orgs/roboticslab-uc3m/projects/2

The robot device drivers are in [yarp-devices](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/yarp-devices).

The robot vision is in [vision](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/vision). Tts/asr is there but will be migrated to [speech](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/speech).

While there is technically no software architecture diagram, as it is flexible, a good example can be found at: https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/follow-me

Also still lots of material on [the wiki](http://robots.uc3m.es)!

We'll be porting material and updating little by little!

Keep up on this on: https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/QA/issues/2 and https://github.com/orgs/roboticslab-uc3m/projects/2

Put an [issue](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/teo-software-manual/issues/new) if you have any doubts!
