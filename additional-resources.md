# Additional documentation about TEO humanoid robot software

Also still lots of material on [the wiki](http://robots.uc3m.es)!

We'll be porting material and updating little by little!

Keep up on this on: https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/QA/issues/2 and https://github.com/orgs/roboticslab-uc3m/projects/2

Put an [issue](https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/teo-software-manual/issues/new) if you have any doubts!
