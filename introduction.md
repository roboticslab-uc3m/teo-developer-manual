## Where should I start?

Read the Introduction section of the Developer manual: [Developer Manual (Introduction)](http://robots.uc3m.es/gitbook-developer-manual/introduction.html)

As a bare minimum to try the simulator, install the following (note: there is a shortcut via the superbuild https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/teo-main but let's follow this minimalistic procedure instead), each with their own dependencies:
- https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/openrave-yarp-plugins
- https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/teo-openrave-models
- https://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/teo-configuration-files
